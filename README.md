# Decoding-Protein-Protein-Interactions-A-Model
This project predicts protein-protein interactions (PPI) using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Classifier. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and visualizations to enhance accuracy. The goal is to improve PPI classification, aiding bioinformatics and drug discovery. ðŸš€
